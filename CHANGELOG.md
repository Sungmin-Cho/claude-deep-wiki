# Changelog

All notable changes to deep-wiki are documented here.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Obsidian CLI integration** — `/wiki-setup` now auto-detects the Obsidian CLI (`obsidian`) when the wiki is inside an Obsidian vault. When detected, wiki commands use Obsidian's full-text search, backlink graph, orphan detection, and unresolved link tracking for more accurate results.
- **Enhanced search in `/wiki-ingest` and `/wiki-query`** — When Obsidian CLI is available, overlap detection and content search use `obsidian search:context` instead of Grep, leveraging Obsidian's text index.
- **Graph-based query expansion** — `/wiki-query` adds a Layer 2.5 that follows backlinks to discover related pages beyond keyword matching (Obsidian CLI only).
- **Improved lint checks** — `/wiki-lint`, `/wiki-ingest` auto-lint, and `/wiki-rebuild` auto-lint use `obsidian orphans`, `obsidian unresolved`, and `obsidian backlinks` for more accurate structural health checks. All vault-wide results are post-filtered to the wiki boundary.
- **Hybrid SessionStart scan** — The auto-ingest hook supplements `find`-based scanning with `obsidian recents` (union + deduplicate). All candidates pass mtime verification to prevent ingesting unmodified files.
- **`obsidian` in recommended tools** — Added to `wiki-schema.yaml` CLI tools list.

### Changed

- **Config schema extended** — `~/.claude/deep-wiki-config.yaml` gains an optional `obsidian_cli` block with `available`, `vault_name`, `vault_path`, and `wiki_prefix` fields. Absence of this block means filesystem-only mode (fully backward compatible).
- **`/wiki-setup` re-run safety** — Re-running setup now removes stale `obsidian_cli` config blocks before re-detection, preventing stale config when CLI is uninstalled.
- **macOS compatibility** — SessionStart hook detects `timeout`/`gtimeout` availability instead of assuming GNU coreutils.

### Design Principles

- **Progressive enhancement** — Obsidian CLI enhances but never replaces filesystem operations. All commands fall back gracefully when the app is not running.
- **Wiki boundary filtering** — All vault-wide CLI results (`orphans`, `unresolved`, `tags`) are post-filtered to `wiki_prefix/pages/` to prevent unrelated vault notes from polluting reports.
- **Writes stay filesystem-based** — Page creation/modification, lock management, index/log updates all use Write/Edit tools for precise control.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Auto-ingest SessionStart hook** — Automatically detects new/modified files in the Obsidian vault on every Claude Code session start and ingests them into the wiki. No manual action needed.
- **Batch ingest support** — `/wiki-ingest` now supports batch processing of multiple files from the auto-ingest hook, with single lock acquisition and grouped log entries.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-07

### Milestone

First stable release. All core features from Karpathy's LLM Wiki gist are implemented, and the plugin has been validated against a real Obsidian vault migration (700+ files → 107 wiki pages).

### Added (since 0.2.0)

- **Real-world validation** — Full vault migration of PARA-structured Obsidian vault (PROJECT, RESOURCE, AREA, ARCHIVE, DAILY notes) into deep-wiki, proving the system works at scale.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Query auto-filing** — When `/wiki-query` synthesizes insights across 2+ pages, the result is automatically filed back into the wiki as a `query-synthesis` page. Implements Karpathy's principle that valuable query results should compound back into the knowledge base.
- **Auto-lint after write operations** — Lint checks run automatically after every `/wiki-ingest` and `/wiki-rebuild`. Auto-fixes structural issues (index drift, excess versions) silently; only reports issues requiring human judgment. Users no longer need to remember to lint.
- **Recommended tools check in `/wiki-setup`** — Setup now checks for CLI tools (qmd, marp) and Obsidian plugins (Dataview, Marp Slides, Web Clipper) and reports installation status with install commands.
- **`recommended-tools.md` reference document** — Detailed guide for qmd, Marp, Dataview, Marp Slides, and Obsidian Web Clipper.
- **`recommended_tools` and `auto_lint` schema definitions** in `wiki-schema.yaml`.
- **CHANGELOG.md / CHANGELOG.ko.md** — This file.

### Fixed

- **`wiki-lint.md` step numbering** — Steps 8, 8, 10, 10 corrected to 8, 9, 10, 11.

### Changed

- `/wiki-query` is no longer read-only. It now writes auto-filed synthesis pages when cross-page insights are detected.
- `/wiki-ingest` now includes an auto-lint step (Step 13) before the final report.
- `/wiki-rebuild` now includes an auto-lint step (Step 5) before reporting.
- `wiki-schema` skill updated with Auto-Lint and Query Auto-Filing sections.
- `wiki-schema.yaml` updated with `auto_lint`, `query_auto_filing`, and `log.actions` definitions.
- READMEs (EN/KO) updated with recommended tools section, Obsidian auto-check description, and revised command descriptions.
